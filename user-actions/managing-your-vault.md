# Managing your Vault

After selecting a Vault, click on the Edit icon on the top right to manage the vault.

1. **Details**: View your vault details.

2. **Backup**: Backup your vault share. Do NOT store vault shares from different devices at the same location, since anyone with sufficient vault shares can access your assets.

3. **Rename**: Edit your vault name.

4. **Reshare**: Reshare vault with a new set of devices. The previous vault shares will always be "active" and can still access the same vault/addresses. If your previous shares have been compromised, do not Reshare. Instead, please create a new Vault, and immediately move all assets from the old Vault.
