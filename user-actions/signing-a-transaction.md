# Signing a Transaction

1. Depending on your Vault types (2-of-2, 2-of-3, 3-of-4, or m-of-n), you need to have the requisite number of devices ready for the signing process.&#x20;

2. On one of your device, prepare the transaction (e.g. Send or Swap). When ready, click on **Continue**.&#x20;

3. Confirm all the details on the Verify screen, check all boxes for the reminder messages, and click **Sign**.&#x20;
